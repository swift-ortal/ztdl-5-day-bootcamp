"""Build a language detector model

The goal of this exercise is to train a linear classifier on text features
that represent sequences of up to N consecutive characters so as to be
recognize natural languages by using the frequencies of short character
sequences as 'fingerprints'.

The script saves the trained model to disk for later use
